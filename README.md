## Welcome to my website

My name is David O'Brien and I am a keen developer. Always looking to learn new things and expand my language. I am currently trying to learn laravel as well as further improve my PHP. But I have some knowledge in other languages such as Java, Javascript, Python, and Ruby. I am also learning more about django as well as improving my python knowledge and shortly I will begin some projects to display here.

I am a junior/graduate developer and I am open to new roles, please check out my github repositories below:

I would like to get the python ones hosted very soon, this is a WIP also and onces they're hosted I will be providing a link alongside the github repo link.
